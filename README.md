This is a guessing game. Comp will randomly prompt 1 of 5 questions and user will need to guess the correct answer.
UPDATE!
We added
- A do-while loop to contintuosly ask 5 questions without the need for refresh.
- The users guess and the correct answer into the alert message after each question.
- Ensured clean coding style
